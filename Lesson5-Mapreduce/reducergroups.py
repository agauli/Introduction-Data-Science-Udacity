"""We might want to help students form study groups. But first we want 
to see if there are already students on forums that communicate a lot 
between themselves.
As the first step for this analysis we have been tasked with writing a 
mapreduce program that for each forum thread (that is a question node with 
all it's answers and comments) would give us a list of students that 
have posted there - either asked the question, answered a question or added a 
comment. If a student posted to that thread several times, they should be added to that
list several times as well, to indicate intensity of communication."""
